## Question 7.
There is irrefutable evidence that vaccines have been beneficial for a series of diseases, such as Diphteria with a 100% decrease of cases, Mumps with a 98.1% decrease of cases, Pertussis with a 91.0% decrease of cases, Smallpox with a 100% decrease of cases, Rubella with a 99.9% decrease of cases, Haemophilus influenzae type b, invasive with a 99.8% decrease of cases, Polio with a 100% decrease of cases, and Tetanus with a 98.6% decrease of cases. This was found from [here](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/vaccine-benefits).  Since smallpox has been eradicated from Earth, besides in vials in "black" research sites, and other such research sites, this is an amazing accomplishment.  Considering how infective this disease is, by eliminating the potential of running into it on the street, means we no longer need to vaccinate individuals.  This has been supported by many sources, but I got it from [here](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/).  This source also mentions the idea of "Herd Protection."  Through decreasing the liklihood of a majority of people getting the disease, but not necessarily all, it decreases the chances that even those not vaccinated will come accross it.  While this is a risky strategy, it has been found to work for the Hib vaccine in Gambia.

## Question 8.
There's a combination of views affecting the above mentioned.  On average people are incredibly busy, are unintelligent, and/or are lazy.  Because people are busy, they may not have the time to analyze the paper and think critically about it.  The data was used incorrectly, and people will just blindly follow "professionals," because there have also been an increase in the number of observed cases of Autism.  Therefore they think, "there needs to be some explanation for it," and since this highly professional scientist proposed it, it must be true.  People that are lazy will follow the combined logic of the two above, where they do not want to put the time into it, and they just want to take the easy road.  Additionally people have this belief that there has to be something negative with something that positive.  It greatly decreases your chance of contracting a disease so therefore there has to be some sort of "cost."  The damage to public medicine is that it tarnishes the reputation.  A study done correctly and finding out something that is life changing, may not gain acknowledgment or momentum becuase now they have to be incredibly critical.  I believe that research institutions and universities are now being critical about the public exposure.  However the rule should be something like a triple-peer check, where it's been checked by other researchers not directly involved with the research.  It is also important that they are unbiased when looking at the reserach done.

I do not believe this is enough.  There should be a public announcement made by him, saying that his research was bullshit, and no one should restrict their children from vaccines because of the research he did.  Even hearing about that news article or broadcast, would be far reaching and get the word out.

## Question 10.

### Matt's Reactions to the talk
I was very interested in how the guest speakers talked about the data that they get access to in their field! While many people have to get permission and jump through many hoops to collect data, the health data that they get to use comes straight from the doctors offices (originally). They mentioned several other tools similar to R Studio that they use to manipulate and view data, which is exciting because it shows how the skills learned in these powerful languages are very useful/applicable to the real world.
